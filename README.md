# life-insurance
I analyze Prudential's life insurance classification dataset and deanonymize the 8 health classes that were given using Prudential underwriting guidelines.

I explore the 127 columns of data in an understandable manner, clean the data, and engineer several useful features. I also test a ridge classifier, logistic regression, random forest classifier before optimizing an XGBoost classifier using offsets.
